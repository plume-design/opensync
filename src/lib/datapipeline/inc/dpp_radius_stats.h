/*
 * This is the intersection header of SM and DPP holding the common object definitions.
 * The common data object dpp_radius_stats_rec_t is typedefed:
 *
 *  1. to dppline_radius_stats_rec_t in dppline.c
 *  2. to sm_radius_stats_t          in sm.h
 *
 * If we'd want to enforce type-safety between the modules, we could use single-member structs.
 *
 * This way we can shave off some computing/mem-allocation by only allocating a record object
 * once and then pass around a pointer. Some extra care must be taken when doing it this way,
 * to not end up with memory leaks. For this reason the following "promises" are made:
 *
 *  1. When an entity transfers its ownership of a memory resource to another entity
 *     (by passing a pointer to the resource to the latter), it promises to not use
 *     the resource, unless the respective pointer is passed back to it again.
 *  2. When an entity owning the resource doesn't transfer the ownership it promises to
 *     properly free the resource (for example, by calling FREE).
 *  3. When an entity binds a resource to a non-standard object that needs to be released
 *     in a specific manner, it promises to provide means to do so without requiring the
 *     entity releasing the resource to know anything about the binding object.
