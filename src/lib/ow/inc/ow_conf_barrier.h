/**
 * This function waits for configurations to be applied.
 *
 * This is intended to be called from a non-mainloop threads
 * to synchronize against osw_confsync and ow_conf work.
 *
 * It is safe to call this immediatelly after ow_conf_*()
 * calls that modify a steady-state system into possible
 * non-steady state that needs a reconfig.
 *
 * @param timeout_msec Provides a time limit. Required. If
 *                     timeout is reached before ow_conf
 *                     gets into a steady state EAGAIN will
 *                     be returned.
 * @return 0 on success
 *         EAGAIN on timeout or error
